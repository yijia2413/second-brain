/**
 * Recall output sizing (#238).
 *
 * recall used to return the full content of every match with no cap on total
 * size — topK limits the COUNT of results, not their bytes — so one call could
 * return an unbounded payload and blow a client's context window. This module
 * bounds that: return enough to decide, and let the caller fetch the few
 * memories it actually needs in full via the `get` tool.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Short memories are returned WHOLE and marked complete. Only oversized ones
 *   are cut, so a consumer does not learn to distrust every result.
 * - The top matches get a much larger allowance than the tail: they are usually
 *   the answer, while the tail is context.
 * - Truncation is marked machine-legibly (with the id and the missing length),
 *   so the affordance to fetch the rest travels with the snippet itself. The
 *   failure mode this guards against is a model treating a cut snippet as the
 *   complete memory and answering confidently from partial text.
