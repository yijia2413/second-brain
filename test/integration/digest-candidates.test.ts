/**
 * The digest-candidate query, run for real.
 *
 * Its correctness IS the SQL: which tags come back decides which tags get compressed, and
 * a nightly run only compresses COMPRESSION_MAX_TAGS_PER_RUN of them. `test/helpers/d1-mock.ts`
 * cannot evaluate SQL — its digest-candidate branch calls isTopicTag(), the TypeScript half
 * of the rule — so a WHERE clause that drifted from that predicate would pass every
 * mock-based test in the suite. This runs the clause itself against real SQLite.
 *
 * The WHERE fragments are imported rather than retyped, so this exercises the same strings
 * src/compression/nightly.ts and src/routes/admin.ts embed.
